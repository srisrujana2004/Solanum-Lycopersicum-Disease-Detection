# Solanum-Lycopersicum-Disease-Detection

Solanum lycopersicum, commonly known as the tomato, is indeed a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. The repository contains code for training an AlexNet model on a dataset of labeled tomato images representing different disease classes. The trained model can then classify diseases in new tomato images, aiding in early disease detection and crop management.

Key Features:

Utilizes deep learning techniques with AlexNet architecture for disease detection in tomato plants.
Dataset includes 10 disease classes and one healthy class
